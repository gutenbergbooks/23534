<h3>There are lots of things that
are considered perfectly acceptable ... provided they don't
work. And of course everyone
knows they really don't, which
is why they're acceptable....
</h3>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />




<p>There are times when I
don't know my own
strength. Or, at least,
the strength of my advice.
And the case of
Jason Howley was certainly an instance
of one of those times.</p>

<p>When he came to my office with
his gadget, I heard him out, trying
to appear both interested and co-operative&mdash;which
is good business.
But I am forced to admit that
neither Howley nor his gadget were
very impressive. He was a lean,
slope-shouldered individual, five-feet-eight
or nine&mdash;which was shorter
than he looked&mdash;with straight
brown hair combed straight back
and blue eyes which were shielded
with steel-rimmed glasses. The thick,
double-concave lenses indicated a degree
of myopia that must have bordered
on total blindness without
glasses, and acute tunnel vision, even
with them.</p>

<p>He had a crisp, incisive manner
that indicated he was either a man
who knew what he was doing or a
man who was trying to impress me
with a ready-made story. I listened
to him and looked at his gadget without
giving any more indication than
necessary of what I really thought.</p>

<p>When he was through, I said:
"You understand, Mr. Howley that
I'm not a patent lawyer; I specialize
in criminal law. Now, I can recommend&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he cut me off. "I understand
that, counselor," he said sharply.
"Believe me, I have no illusion whatever
that this thing is patentable under
the present patent system. Even
if it were, this gadget is designed to
do something that may or may not
be illegal, which would make it
hazardous to attempt to patent it, I
should think. You don't patent new
devices for blowing safes or new
drugs for doping horses, do you?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," I said dryly, "although,
as I say, I'm not qualified
to give an opinion on patent law.
You say that gadget is designed to
cause minute, but significant, changes
in the velocities of small, moving
objects. Just how does that make it
illegal?"</p>

<p>He frowned a little. "Well, possibly
it wouldn't, except here in
Nevada. Specifically, it is designed
to influence roulette and dice
games."</p>

<p>I looked at the gadget with a
little more interest this time. There
was nothing new in the idea of inventing
a gadget to cheat the red-and-black
wheels, of course; the local
cops turn up a dozen a day here in
the city. Most of them either don't
work at all or else they're too obvious,
so the users get nabbed before
they have a chance to use them.</p>

<p>The only ones that really work
have to be installed in the tables
themselves, which means they're
used to milk the suckers, not rob the
management. And anyone in the
State of Nevada who buys a license
to operate and then uses crooked
wheels is (a) stupid, and (b) out of
business within a week. Howley was
right. Only in a place where gambling
is legalized is it illegal&mdash;and
unprofitable&mdash;to rig a game.</p>

<p>The gadget itself didn't look too
complicated from the outside. It was
a black plastic box about an inch
and a half square and maybe three
and a half long. On one end was a
lensed opening, half an inch in
diameter, and on two sides there
were flat, silver-colored plates. On
the top of it, there was a dial which
was, say, an inch in diameter, and it
was marked off just exactly like a
roulette wheel.</p>

<p>"How does it work?" I asked.</p>

<p>He picked it up in his hand, holding
it as though it were a flashlight,
with the lens pointed away from
him.</p>

<p>"You aim the lens at the wheel,"
he explained, "making sure that
your thumb is touching the silver
plate on one side, and your fingers
touching the plate on the other side.
Then you set this dial for whatever
number you want to come up and
concentrate on it while the ball is
spinning. For dice, of course, you
only need to use the first six or
twelve numbers on the dial, depending
on the game."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I looked at him for a long moment,
trying to figure his angle. He
looked back steadily, his eyes looking
like small beads peering through
the bottoms of a couple of shot
glasses.</p>

<p>"You look skeptical, counselor,"
he said at last.</p>

<p>"I am. A man who hasn't got the
ability to be healthily skeptical has
no right to practice law&mdash;especially
criminal law. On the other hand, no
lawyer has any right to judge anything
one way or the other without
evidence.</p>

<p>"But that's neither here nor there
at the moment. What I'm interested
in is, what do you want me to do?
People rarely come to a criminal
lawyer unless they're in a jam. What
sort of jam are you in at the moment?"</p>

<p>"None," said Howley. "But I will
be very soon. I hope."</p>

<p>Well, I've heard odder statements
than that from my clients. I let it
ride for the moment and looked
down at the notes I'd taken while
he'd told me his story.</p>

<p>"You're a native of New York
City?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's right. That's what I
said."</p>

<p>"And you came out here for
what? To use that thing on our Nevada
tables?"</p>

<p>"That's right, counselor."</p>

<p>"Can't you find any games to
cheat on back home?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. Plenty of them.
But they aren't legal. I wouldn't care
to get mixed up in anything illegal.
Besides, it wouldn't suit my purpose."</p>

<p>That stopped me for a moment.
"You don't consider cheating illegal?
It certainly is in Nevada. In
New York, if you were caught at it,
you'd have the big gambling interests
on your neck; here, you'll have
both them <i>and</i> the police after you.
<i>And</i> the district attorney's office."</p>

<p>He smiled. "Yes, I know. That's
what I'm expecting. That's why I
need a good lawyer to defend me.
I understand you're the top man in
this city."</p>

<p>"Mr. Howley," I said carefully,
"as a member of the Bar Association
and a practicing attorney in the
State of Nevada, I am an Officer of
the Court. If you had been caught
cheating and had come to me, I'd be
able to help you. But I can't enter into
a conspiracy with you to defraud
legitimate businessmen, which is exactly
what this would be."</p>

<p>He blinked at me through those
shot-glass spectacles. "Counselor,
would you refuse to defend a man
if you thought he was guilty?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No. Legally, a
man is not guilty until proven so
by a court of law. He has a right to
trial by jury. For me to refuse to
give a man the defense he is legally
entitled to, just because I happened
to think he was guilty, would be trial
by attorney. I'll do the best I can
for any client; I'll work for his interests,
no matter what my private
opinion may be."</p>

<p>He looked impressed, so I guess
there must have been a note of conviction
in my voice. There should
have been, because it was exactly
what I've always believed and practiced.</p>

<p>"That's good, counselor," said
Howley. "If I can convince you that
I have no criminal intent, that I have
no intention of defrauding anyone
or conspiring with you to do anything
illegal, will you help me?"</p>

<p>I didn't have to think that one
over. I simply said, "Yes." After all,
it was still up to me to decide
whether he convinced me or not. If
he didn't, I could still refuse the case
on those grounds.</p>

<p>"That's fair enough, counselor,"
he said. Then he started talking.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Instead of telling you what Jason
Howley <i>said</i> he was going to do, I'll
tell you what he <i>did</i> do. They are
substantially the same, anyway, and
the old bromide about actions speaking
louder than words certainly applied
in this case.</p>

<p>Mind you, I didn't see or hear any
of this, but there were plenty of witnesses
to testify as to what went on.
Their statements are a matter of
court record, and Jason Howley's
story is substantiated in every respect.</p>

<p>He left my office smiling. He'd
convinced me that the case was not
only going to be worthwhile, but
fun. I took it, plus a fat retainer.</p>

<p>Howley went up to his hotel room,
changed into his expensive evening
clothes, and headed out to do the
town. I'd suggested several places,
but he wanted the biggest and best&mdash;the
Golden Casino, a big, plush, expensive
place that was just inside the
city limits. In his pockets, he was
carrying less than two hundred dollars
in cash.</p>

<p>Now, nobody with that kind of
chicken feed can expect to last long
at the Golden Casino unless they
stick to the two-bit one-armed bandits.
But putting money on a roulette
table is in a higher bracket by far
than feeding a slot machine, even
if you get a steady run of lemons.</p>

<p>Howley didn't waste any time. He
headed for the roulette table right
away. He watched the play for about
three spins of the wheel, then he
took out his gadget&mdash;in plain sight
of anyone who cared to watch&mdash;and
set the dial for thirteen. Then he
held it in his hand with thumb and
finger touching the plates and put
his hand in his jacket pocket, with
the lens aimed at the wheel. He
stepped up to the table, bought a
hundred dollars worth of chips, and
put fifty on Number Thirteen.</p>

<p>"No more bets," said the croupier.
He spun the wheel and dropped the
ball.</p>

<p>"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,"
he chanted after a minute. With a
practiced hand, he raked in the
losers and pushed out Howley's winnings.
There was sixteen hundred
dollars sitting on thirteen now. Howley
didn't touch it.</p>

<p>The wheel went around and the
little ball clattered around the rim
and finally fell into a slot.</p>

<p>"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,"
said the croupier. This time, he
didn't look as nonchalant. He peered
curiously at Howley as he pushed out
the chips to make a grand total of
fifty-one thousand two hundred dollars.
The same number doesn't come
up twice in succession very often,
and it is very rare indeed that the
same person is covering it both times
with a riding bet.</p>

<p>"Two thousand limit, sir," the
croupier said, when it looked as
though Howley was going to let the
fifty-one grand just sit there.</p>

<p>Howley nodded apologetically and
pulled off everything but two thousand
dollars worth of chips.</p>

<p>The third time around, the croupier
had his eyes directly on Howley
as he repeated the chant: "Thirteen,
Black, Odd, and Low." Everybody
else at the table was watching Howley,
too. The odds against Howley&mdash;or
anyone else, for that matter&mdash;hitting
the same number three times
in a row are just under forty thousand
to one.</p>

<p>Howley didn't want to overdo it.
He left two thousand on thirteen,
raked in the rest, and twisted the
dial on his gadget over a notch.</p>

<p>Everyone at the table gasped as
the little ball dropped.</p>

<p>"That was a near miss," whispered
a woman standing nearby.</p>

<p>The croupier said: "Fourteen, Red,
Even, and Low." And he raked in
Howley's two thousand dollars with
a satisfied smile. He had seen runs
of luck before.</p>

<p>Howley deliberately lost two
more spins the same way. Nobody
who was actually cheating would call
too much attention to himself, and
Howley wanted it to look as though
he were trying to cover up the fact
that he had a sure thing.</p>

<p>He took the gadget out of his
pocket and deliberately set it to the
green square marked 00. Then he
put it back in his pocket and put two
thousand dollars on the Double
Zero.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was more than suspicion in
the croupier's eyes when he raked in
all the bets on the table except Howley's.
It definitely didn't look good
to him. A man who had started out
with a fifty-dollar bet had managed
to run it up to one hundred seventy-four
thousand two hundred dollars
in six plays.</p>

<p>Howley looked as innocent as possible
under the circumstances, and
carefully dropped the dial on his
gadget back a few notches. Then he
bet another two thousand on High,
an even money bet.</p>

<p>Naturally, he won.</p>

<p>He twisted the dial back a few
more notches and won again on
High.</p>

<p>Then he left it where it was and
won by betting on Red.</p>

<p>By this time, of course, things
were happening. The croupier had
long since pressed the alarm button,
and five men had carefully surrounded
Howley. They looked like
customers, but they were harder-looking
than the average, and they
were watching Howley, not the
wheel. Farther back from the crowd,
three of the special deputies from
the sheriff's office were trying to look
inconspicuous in their gray uniforms
and white Stetsons and pearl-handled
revolvers in black holsters. You can
imagine how inconspicuous they
looked.</p>

<p>Howley decided to do it up brown.
He reset his gadget as surreptitiously
as possible under the circumstances,
and put his money on
thirteen again.</p>

<p>"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,"
said the croupier in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>The five men in evening dress and
the three deputies moved in closer.</p>

<p>Howley nonchalantly scraped in
his winnings, leaving the two thousand
on the thirteen spot.</p>

<p>There was a combination of hostility
and admiration in every eye
around the table when the croupier
said, "Thirteen, Black, Odd, and
Low" for the fifth time in the space
of minutes. And everyone of those
eyes was turned on Jason Howley.</p>

<p>The croupier smiled his professional
smile. "I'm sorry, ladies and
gentlemen; we'll have to discontinue
play for a while. The gentleman has
broken the bank at this table." He
turned the smile on Howley. "Congratulations,
sir."</p>

<p>Howley smiled back and began
stacking up over three hundred
thousand dollars worth of plastic
disks. It made quite a pile.</p>

<p>One of the deputies stepped up
politely. "I'm an officer, sir," he said.
"May I help you carry that to the
cashier's office?"</p>

<p>Howley looked at the gold star
and nodded. "Certainly. Thanks."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="illus2" id="illus2"></a>
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The other two deputies stepped
up, too, and the three of them walked
Howley toward the cashier's
office. Behind them came the five men
in dinner jackets.</p>

<p>"You'll have to step into the office
to cash that much, sir," said one of
the deputies as he opened the door.
Howley walked in as though he
hadn't a care in the world. He put
his chips on the desk, and the deputies
followed suit, while one of the
dinner-jacketed men closed the door.</p>

<p>Then one of the deputies said: "I
believe this gentleman is carrying a
gun."</p>

<p>He had his own revolver out and
had it pointed at Howley's middle.
"Carrying a concealed weapon is
illegal in this city," he went on.
"I'm afraid we'll have to search
you."</p>

<p>Howley didn't object. He put his
hands up high and stood there while
his pockets were frisked.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the deputy
coolly. "What on Earth is this?"</p>

<p>It was Howley's gadget, and the
dial still pointed to Thirteen&mdash;Black,
Odd, and Low.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next morning, I went down
to the jail in response to a phone
call from Howley. The special deputies
had turned him over to the city
police and he was being held "under
suspicion of fraud." I knew we
could beat that down to an "attempt
to defraud," but the object was to
get Howley off scott-free. After
Howley told me the whole story, I
got busy pushing the case through.
As long as he was simply being held
on suspicion, I couldn't get him out
on bail, so I wanted to force the district
attorney or the police to prefer
charges.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I made sure that
Howley's gadget had been impounded
as evidence. I didn't want anyone
fiddling with it before the case
went to court&mdash;except, of course, the
D. A. and his men. There wasn't
much I could do to keep it out of
<i>their</i> hands.</p>

<p>After throwing as much weight
around as I could, including filing a
petition for a writ of habeas corpus
with Judge Grannis, I went over to
Howley's hotel with a signed power
of attorney that Howley had given
me, and I got a small envelope out
of the hotel safe. It contained a baggage
check.</p>

<p>I went over to the bus depot, turned
over the check to the baggage
department, and went back to my
office with a small suitcase. I locked
myself in and opened the case. Sure
enough, it contained three dozen of
the little gadgets.</p>

<p>Then I sat down to wait. By noon,
Judge Grannis had issued the writ
of habeas corpus, and, rather than
release Jason Howley, the police had
booked him, and District Attorney
Thursby was getting the case ready
for the grand jury. There was over
a quarter of a million dollars at
stake, and the men behind the Golden
Casino were bringing pressure to
bear. If Howley wasn't convicted,
they'd have to give him his money&mdash;and
that was the last thing they
wanted to do. A quarter of a million
bucks isn't small potatoes, even to a
gambling syndicate.</p>

<p>It wasn't until early on the morning
of the third day after Howley's
arrest that I got a tip-off from one
of my part-time spies. I scooped up
the phone when it rang and identified
myself.</p>

<p>"Counselor? Look, this is Benny."
I recognized the voice and name.
Benny was one of the cabbies that I'd
done favors for in the past.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Benny?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no trouble. I just got a little
tip you might be interested in."</p>

<p>"Fire away."</p>

<p>"Well, the D.A. and some of his
boys went into the Golden Casino
about ten minutes ago, and now
they're closin' up the place. Just for
a little while, I understand. Hour,
maybe. They're chasin' everyone out
of the roulette room."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Benny," I said, "thanks
a lot."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew you was working
on that Howley case, and I thought
this might be important, so I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, Benny. Come by my office
this afternoon. And thanks again."</p>

<p>I hung up and started moving.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes, I was pulling
up and parking across the street
from the Golden Casino. I locked
the car and dodged traffic to get
across the street, as though I'd never
heard of laws against jaywalking.</p>

<p>There were still plenty of people
in the Casino. The bar was full, and
the dice and card games were going
full blast. The slot machines were
jingling out their infernal din while
fools fed coins into their insatiable
innards.</p>

<p>But the roulette room was closed,
and a couple of be-Stetsoned deputies
were standing guard over the
entrance. I headed straight for
them.</p>

<p>Both of them stood pat, blocking
my way, so I stopped a few feet in
front of them.</p>

<p>"Hello, counselor," said one.
"Sorry, the roulette room's closed."</p>

<p>I knew the man slightly. "Let me
in, Jim," I said. "I want to see
Thursby."</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances. Obviously,
the D.A. had given them
orders.</p>

<p>"Can't do it, counselor," said Jim.
"We're not to let anyone in."</p>

<p>"Tell Thursby I'm out here and
that I want to see him."</p>

<p>He shrugged, opened the door,
stuck his head inside, and called to
District Attorney Thursby to tell
him that I was outside. I could hear
Thursby's muffled "Damn!" from
within. But when he showed up at
the door, his face was all smiles.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" he asked
pleasantly.</p>

<p>I smiled back, giving him my
best. "No trouble at all, Thursby. I
just wanted to watch the experiment."</p>

<p>"Experiment?" He looked honestly
surprised, which was a fine piece
of acting. "We're just checking to
see if the table's wired, that's all. If
it is, your client may be in the clear;
maybe we can hang it on the croupier."</p>

<p>"And get a conspiracy charge on
my client, too, eh? Well, if you
don't mind, I'd like to watch that
table check myself. You know how
it is."</p>

<p>Thursby hesitated, then he scowled.
"Oh, all right. Come on in. But
stay out of the way."</p>

<p>I grinned. "Sure. All I want to do
is protect my client's interests."</p>

<p>Thursby just grunted and opened
the door wider to let me in. He was
a shrewd lawyer, a good D.A., and
basically honest, even if he did have
a tendency to bend under pressure
from higher up.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They were checking the table, all
right. They had three specialists
going over it with everything from
fine tooth combs to Geiger counters.
They found nothing. No magnets,
no wires, no mechanical gimmicks.
Nothing.</p>

<p>It took them an hour to take that
table apart, check it, and put it back
together again. When it was all
over, Thursby glanced at me, then
said: "O.K., boys; that does it. Let's
go."</p>

<p>The men looked at him oddly, and
I knew why.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to test my
client's gadget?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>Thursby looked angrily baffled for
a moment, then he clamped his lips
grimly. "As long as we're here, I
guess we might as well."</p>

<p>I knew perfectly well it was what
he had intended to do all along.</p>

<p>"One of you guys spin that
wheel," he said to the technicians.
One of them gave the wheel a spin
and dropped the ball. It clattered on
its merry way and dropped into a
slot. Forty-two.</p>

<p>Thursby took the gadget out of
his pocket. It was still set at Thirteen.</p>

<p>The men who had surrounded
Howley on the night of his arrest
had been keeping their eyes open,
and they had seen how Howley had
handled the thing. Well&mdash;<i>almost</i>
how. Thursby had the lens opening
pointed at the wheel, but his thumb
and fingers weren't touching the silver
plates properly.</p>

<p>"Spin it again," he said.</p>

<p>Everyone's eyes were on the ball
as it whirled, so I had time to get
my own copy of Howley's gadget
out and set it at Thirteen. I hoped
the thing would work for me. I concentrated
on Thirteen, making sure
my thumb and fingers were placed
right.</p>

<p>Evidently they were. The ball fell
into Thirteen, Black, Odd, and
Low.</p>

<p>A huge grin spread over Thursby's
face, but he was man enough
not to turn and grin at me. "Try it
again," he said.</p>

<p>Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the thing works?"
said Thursby, looking at the gadget
in a sort of pleased awe.</p>

<p>"You'd better be able to prove
that it <i>does</i> work, Thursby," I said,
trying to put irritation into my
voice.</p>

<p>This time, he did grin at me. "Oh,
I think we can prove that, all right."
He turned back to the technician.
"Spin it once more, Sam, and show
the defense counsel, here, how it
works."</p>

<p>The technician did as he was told.
"Thirteen, Black, Odd, and Low,"
he chanted, grinning.</p>

<p>"Let's try another number,"
Thursby said. He turned the dial to
One. And this time, when he pointed
it, his fingers were touching the
plates in the right places.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," I said. "Let me
spin that thing."</p>

<p>"Be my guest, counselor," said
Thursby.</p>

<p>I spun the wheel and scooted the
ball along the rim. It dropped into
a slot. One, Red, Odd, and Low. I
looked as disappointed and apprehensive
as I could.</p>

<p>"Co-incidence," I said. "Nothing
more. You haven't proved anything."</p>

<p>Thursby's grin widened. "Of
course I haven't," he said with a
soothing, patronizing tone. "But I
don't have to prove anything until
I get to court."</p>

<p>Then he looked at the technicians
and jerked his head toward the door.
"Let's go, boys. Maybe the counselor
wants to look over the table
for himself. Maybe he thinks we've
got it rigged."</p>

<p>There was a chorus of guffaws as
they walked out. I just stood there,
scowling, trying to keep from laughing
even harder than they were.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jason Howley sat next to me at
the defense table, just inside the low
partition that divided the court
from the public. There weren't many
people in the auditorium itself; listening
to some poor dope get himself
sentenced for cheating at gambling
is considered pretty dull
entertainment in the State of Nevada.</p>

<p>Thursby had managed to push the
indictment through the grand jury
in a hurry, but, as he sat across the
room from me at the prosecution
table, I thought I could detect a
false note in the assumed look of
confidence that he was trying to
wear.</p>

<p>Howley tapped me on the shoulder.
I turned around, and he whispered:
"How much longer?"</p>

<p>I tapped my wrist watch. "Couple
minutes. Judge Lapworth is one of
those precisionists. Never a moment
late or early. Getting jumpy?"</p>

<p>He shook his head gently and
smiled. "No. You've handled this
even better than I'd have imagined.
You thought of things I didn't even
know existed. I'm no lawyer; I can
see that."</p>

<p>I returned the smile. "And I don't
invent gimmicks, either. So what?"</p>

<p>His eyes looked at me from behind
the distorting negative lenses.
"I've been wondering, counselor&mdash;why
are you so interested in this? I
mean, I offered you a pretty good
fee, and all that, but it seems to me
you're taking an unusual interest in
the case."</p>

<p>I grinned at him. "Mr. Howley,
my profession is Law&mdash;with a capital
L. The study of the Law isn't like
the study of physics or whatever;
these are manmade laws&mdash;commands,
not descriptions. They don't
necessarily have anything to do with
facts at all. Take the word 'insanity,'
for instance; the word isn't even
used by head-shrinkers any more because
it's a legal definition that has
nothing whatever to do with the condition
of the human mind.</p>

<p>"Now, any such set of laws as that
can't possibly be self-consistent and
still have some use on an action
level. A lawyer's job is to find the
little inconsistencies in the structure,
the places where the pieces have been
jammed together in an effort to make
them look like a structured whole.
To find, in other words, the loopholes
and use them.</p>

<p>"And when I find a loophole, I
like to wring everything I can out
of it. I'm enjoying this."</p>

<p>Howley nodded. "I see. But what
if something&mdash;"</p>

<p>I held up my hand to silence him,
because the door to the judges' chambers
opened at that moment, and
Judge Lapworth came in as the bailiff
announced him. We all stood up
while the bailiff intoned his "Oyez,
oyez."</p>

<p>Thursby made a short preliminary
speech to the jury, and I requested
and was granted permission to hold
my own opening statement until the
defense was ready to present its
case.</p>

<p>Thursby was looking worried, although
it took a trained eye to see it.
I was pretty sure I knew why. He
had been pushed too hard and had
gone too fast. He'd managed to slide
through the grand jury too easily,
and I had managed to get the trial
date set for a week later. Thursby's
case was far from being as tight as
he wanted it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I just sat still while the prosecution
brought forth its witnesses and
evidence. The croupier, the deputies,
several employees of the Golden
Casino, and a couple of patrons all
told their stories. I waived cross-examination
in every case, which made
Thursby even edgier than he had
been.</p>

<p>When he called in the head of the
technicians who had inspected the
table at the casino, I made no objection
to his testimony, but I made my
first cross-examination.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thompson, you have stated
your qualifications as an expert on
the various devices which have been
used to illegally influence the operation
of gambling devices in this
state."</p>

<p>Thursby said: "Oh, if the Court
please, I should like to remind counsel
for the defense that he has already
accepted the qualifications of the
witness."</p>

<p>"I am not attempting to impugn
the qualifications of the witness," I
snapped.</p>

<p>Judge Lapworth frowned at Thursby.
"Are you making an objection,
Mr. District Attorney?"</p>

<p>Thursby pursed his lips, said,
"No, Your Honor," and sat down.</p>

<p>"Proceed with the cross-examination,"
said the judge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Thompson," I said, "you
have testified that you examined the
table at the Golden Casino for such
devices and found none. Is that
right?"</p>

<p>"That's right," he said positively.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the device labeled
People's Exhibit A, which was found
by the officers on the person of the
defendant?"</p>

<p>"Well ... yes. I have."</p>

<p>"Have you examined this device?"</p>

<p>Thursby was on his feet. "Objection,
Your Honor! This material was
not brought out in direct examination!"</p>

<p>"Sustained," said Judge Lapworth.</p>

<p>"Very well, Your Honor," I said.
Then I turned back to Thompson.
"As an expert in this field, Mr.
Thompson, you have examined many
different devices for cheating gambling
equipment, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have."</p>

<p>"How many, would you say?"</p>

<p>"Oh ... several hundred."</p>

<p>"Several hundred different <i>types</i>?"</p>

<p>"No. Several hundred individual
devices. Most of them are just variations
of two or three basic types."</p>

<p>"And you are familiar with the
function of these basic types and
their variations?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"You know exactly how all of
them work, then?"</p>

<p>He saw where I was heading.
"Most of them," he hedged.</p>

<p>Thursby saw where I was heading,
too, and was sweating. I'd managed
to get around his objection.</p>

<p>"Have you ever examined any
which you could not understand?"</p>

<p>"I ... I don't quite know what
you mean."</p>

<p>"Have you ever," I said firmly,
"come across a device used in cheating
which you could not comprehend
or explain the operation of?"</p>

<p>Thursby stood up. "Same objection
as before, Your Honor."</p>

<p>"Your Honor," I said, "I am merely
trying to find the limitations of
the witness' knowledge; I am not
trying to refute his acknowledged
ability."</p>

<p>"Overruled," said Judge Lapworth.
"The witness will answer the
question."</p>

<p>I repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Yes," Thompson said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"More than once?"</p>

<p>"Only once."</p>

<p>"Only once. You did find one device
which didn't operate in any
fashion you can explain. Is that
right?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me what this device
was?"</p>

<p>Thompson took a deep breath. "It
was People's Exhibit A&mdash;the device
taken from the defendant at the time
of his arrest."</p>

<p>There was a buzz in the courtroom.</p>

<p>"No more questions," I said, turning
away. Then, before Thompson
could leave the stand, I turned back
to him. "Oh, just one moment, Mr.
Thompson. Did you examine this device
carefully? Did you take it
apart?"</p>

<p>"I opened it and looked at it."</p>

<p>"You just looked at it? You
didn't subject it to any tests?"</p>

<p>Thompson took a deep breath.
"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't anything inside it
to test."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This time, there was more than
just a buzz around the courtroom.
Judge Lapworth rapped for order.</p>

<p>When the room was quiet, I said:
"The box was empty, then?"</p>

<p>"Well, no. Not exactly empty. It
had some stuff in it."</p>

<p>I turned to the judge. "If the
Court please, I would like to have the
so-called device, Exhibit A, opened
so that the members of the jury may
see for themselves what it contains."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="illus3" id="illus3"></a>
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" alt=""/>
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />



<p>Judge Lapworth said: "The Court
would like very much to see the internal
workings of this device, too.
Bailiff, if you will, please."</p>

<p>The bailiff handed him the gadget
from the exhibit table.</p>

<p>"How does it open?" asked the
judge. He turned to Thompson.
"Will the witness please open the
box?"</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Thompson thumbed
the catch and slid off the top.</p>

<p>The judge took it from him, looked
inside, and stared for a long moment.</p>

<p>I had already seen the insides. It
was painted white, and there were
inked lines running all over the inside,
and various pictures&mdash;a ball, a
pair of dice, a roulette wheel&mdash;and
some other symbols that I didn't pretend
to understand.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the box was empty.</p>

<p>After a moment, Judge Lapworth
looked up from the box and stared
at Thursby. Then he looked at
Thompson. "Just what tests <i>did</i> you
perform on this ... this thing, Mr.
Thompson?"</p>

<p>"Well, Your Honor," Thompson
said, visibly nervous, "I checked it
for all kinds of radiation and magnetism.
There isn't anything like that
coming from it. But," he added
lamely, "there wasn't much else to
test. Not without damaging the
box."</p>

<p>"I see." His honor glared at
Thursby, but didn't say anything to
him. He simply ordered the box to
be shown to the jury.</p>

<p>Thursby was grimly holding his
ground, waiting.</p>

<p>"Have you any more questions,
counselor?" the judge asked.</p>

<p>"No, Your Honor, I have not."</p>

<p>"Witness may step down," said
his honor to Thompson.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Thursby stood up. "If the Court
please, I would like to stage a small
demonstration for the members of
the jury."</p>

<p>The Court gave permission, and
a roulette wheel was hauled in on a
small table.</p>

<p>I watched with interest and without
objection while Thursby demonstrated
the use of the gadget and
then asked each of the jurors in turn
to try it. It was a long way from
being a successful demonstration.
Some of the jurors didn't hold the
thing right, and some of those that
did just didn't have the mental ability
required to use it. But that didn't
bother Thursby.</p>

<p>"Your Honor, and Gentlemen of
the Jury," he said, "you are all aware
that a device constructed for the purpose
of cheating at any gambling
game is not necessarily one hundred
per cent infallible. It doesn't have to
be. All it has to do is turn the odds
in favor of the user.</p>

<p>"You are all familiar with loaded
dice, I'm sure. And you know that
loading dice for one set of numbers
merely increases the probability that
those numbers will come up; it does
not guarantee that they will come up
every time.</p>

<p>"It is the same with marked
cards. Marking the backs of a deck
of cards doesn't mean that you will
invariably get a better hand than your
opponent; it doesn't even mean that
you will win every hand.</p>

<p>"The device taken from the defendant
at the Golden Casino does
not, as you have seen, work every
time. But, as you have also seen, it
certainly <i>does</i> shift the odds by a considerable
percentage. And that, I
submit, is illegal under the laws of
this state."</p>

<p>He went on, building on that
theme for a while, then he turned
the trial over to the defense.</p>

<p>"Call Dr. Pettigrew to the stand,"
I said.</p>

<p>I heard Thursby's gasp, but I ignored
it.</p>

<p>A chunky, balding man with a
moon face and an irritated expression
came up to be sworn in. He was
irritated with me for having subpoenaed
him, and he showed it. I
hoped he wouldn't turn out to be
hostile.</p>

<p>"You are Dr. Herbert Pettigrew?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"That is correct."</p>

<p>"State your residence, please."</p>

<p>"3109 La Jolla Boulevard, Los
Angeles, California."</p>

<p>"You are called 'Doctor' Pettigrew,
I believe. Would you tell the
Court what right you have to that
title?"</p>

<p>He looked a little miffed, but he
said: "It is a scholarly title. A Doctorate
of Philosophy in physics
from Massachusetts Institute of
Technology."</p>

<p>"I see. Would you mind telling the
Court what other academic degrees
you have?"</p>

<p>He reeled off a list of them, all
impressive.</p>

<p>"Thank you, doctor," I said.
"Now, what is your present occupation?"</p>

<p>"I am a Professor of Physics, at
the University of California in Los
Angeles."</p>

<p>I went on questioning him to
establish his ability in his field, and
by the time I was finished, the jury
was pretty well impressed with his
status in the scientific brotherhood.
And not once did Thursby object.</p>

<p>Then I said, "Dr. Pettigrew, I believe
you came to this city on a professional
matter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did." He didn't hesitate
to answer, so I figured I hadn't got
his goat too much.</p>

<p>"And what was the nature of that
matter?"</p>

<p>"I was asked to come here by Mr.
Harold Thursby, the District Attorney,
to perform some scientific tests
on the ... er ... device ... the
device known as People's Exhibit
A."</p>

<p>"Did you perform these tests?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"At the request of District Attorney
Thursby, is that right?"</p>

<p>"That is correct."</p>

<p>"May I ask why Mr. Thursby did
not call you as a witness for the
prosecution?"</p>

<p>Thursby, as I had expected, was
on his feet. "Objection! The question
calls for a conclusion of the witness!"</p>

<p>"Sustained," said Judge Lapworth.</p>

<p>"Dr. Pettigrew," I said, "what
were your findings in reference to
Exhibit A?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "The thing is a plastic
box with a dial set in one side, a
plastic lens in one end, and a couple
of strips of silver along two other
sides. Inside, there are a lot of markings
in black ink on white paint."
He gestured toward the exhibit
table. "Just what you've seen; that's
all there is to it."</p>

<p>"What sort of tests did you perform
to determine this, Dr. Pettigrew?"
I asked.</p>

<p>He took a long time answering
that one. He had X-rayed the thing
thoroughly, tested it with apparatus
I'd never heard of, taken scrapings
from all over it for microchemical
analysis, and even tried it himself on
a roulette wheel. He hadn't been able
to make it work.</p>

<p>"And what is your conclusion
from these findings?" I asked.</p>

<p>Again he shrugged. "The thing is
just a box, that's all. It has no special
properties."</p>

<p>"Would you say that it could be
responsible for the phenomena we
have just seen? By that, I mean the
peculiar action of the roulette wheel,
demonstrated here by the prosecution."</p>

<p>"Definitely not," he stated flatly.
"The box could not possibly have
any effect on either the wheel or the
ball."</p>

<p>"I see. Thank you, doctor; that's
all. Cross-examine."</p>

<p>Thursby walked over to the witness
stand with a belligerent scowl
on his face. "Dr. Pettigrew, you say
that the box couldn't possibly have
had any effect on the wheel. And yet,
we have demonstrated that there <i>is</i>
an effect. Don't you believe the testimony
of your own senses?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I do!" snapped Pettigrew.</p>

<p>"Then how do you account for
the behavior of the roulette wheel
as you have just seen it demonstrated
in this court?"</p>

<p>I suppressed a grin. Thursby was
so mad that he was having trouble
expressing himself clearly.</p>

<p>"In several ways!" Pettigrew said
sharply. "In the first place, that
wheel could be rigged."</p>

<p>Thursby purpled. "Now, just a
minute! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I started to object, but Judge Lapworth
beat me to it.</p>

<p>"Are you objecting to the answer,
Mr. District Attorney?"</p>

<p>"The witness is insinuating that I
falsified evidence!"</p>

<p>"I am not!" said Pettigrew, visibly
angry. "You asked me how I could
account for its behavior, and I told
you one way! There are others!"</p>

<p>"The wheel will be examined,"
said Judge Lapworth darkly. "Tell
us the other ways, Dr. Pettigrew."</p>

<p>"Pure chance," said Pettigrew.
"Pure chance, Your Honor. I'm sure
that everyone in this courtroom has
seen runs of luck on a roulette wheel.
According to the laws of probability,
such runs must inevitably happen.
Frankly, I believe that just such a
run has occurred here. I do not think
for a minute that Mr. Thursby or
anyone else rigged that wheel."</p>

<p>"I see; thank you, Dr. Pettigrew,"
said the judge. "Any further questions,
Mr. District Attorney?"</p>

<p>"No further questions," Thursby
said, trying to hide his anger.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Call your next witness," said the
judge, looking at me.</p>

<p>"I call Mr. Jason Howley to the
stand."</p>

<p>Howley sat down and was sworn
in. I went through the preliminaries,
then asked: "Mr. Howley, you have
seen People's Exhibit A?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"To whom does it belong?"</p>

<p>"It is mine. It was taken from me
by&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just answer the question, please,"
I admonished him. He knew his
script, but he was jumping the gun.
"The device is yours, then?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Under what circumstances did
this device come into the hands of
the police?"</p>

<p>He told what had happened on
the night of the big take at the Golden
Casino.</p>

<p>"Would you explain to us just
what this device is?" I asked when
he had finished.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said. "It's a good
luck charm."</p>

<p>I could hear the muffled reaction
in the courtroom.</p>

<p>"A good luck charm. I see. Then
it has no effect on the wheel at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't say that," Howley said
disarmingly. He smiled and
looked at the jury. "It certainly has
<i>some</i> effect. It's the only good luck
charm I ever had that worked."</p>

<p>The jury was grinning right back
at him. They were all gamblers at
heart, and I never knew a gambler
yet who didn't have some sort of
good luck charm or superstition
when it came to gambling. We had
them all in the palms of our hands.</p>

<p>"What I mean is, does it have any
<i>physical</i> effect on the wheel?"</p>

<p>Howley looked puzzled. "Well, I
don't know about that. That's not my
field. You better ask Dr. Pettigrew."</p>

<p>There was a smothered laugh
somewhere in the courtroom.</p>

<p>"Just how do you operate this
good luck charm, Mr. Howley?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, you just hold it so that
your thumb touches one strip of silver
and your fingers touch the other,
then you set the dial to whatever
number you want to come up and
wish."</p>

<p>"<i>Wish?</i> Just <i>wish</i>, Mr. Howley?"</p>

<p>"Just wish. That's all. What else
can you do with a good luck charm?"</p>

<p>This time, the judge had to pound
for order to stop the laughing.</p>

<p>I turned Howley over to Thursby.</p>

<p>The D.A. hammered at him for
half an hour trying to get something
out of Howley, but he didn't get anywhere
useful. Howley admitted that
he'd come to Nevada to play the
wheels; what was wrong with that?
He admitted that he'd come just to
try out his good luck charm&mdash;and
what was wrong with that? He even
admitted that it worked for him
every time&mdash;</p>

<p>And what was wrong, pray, with
<i>that</i>?</p>

<p>Thursby knew he was licked. He'd
known it for a long time. His summation
to the jury showed it. The
expressions on the faces of the jury
as they listened showed it.</p>

<p>They brought in a verdict of Not
Guilty.</p>

<p>When I got back to my office, I
picked up the phone and called the
Golden Casino. I asked for George
Brockey, the manager. When I got
him on the phone and identified myself,
he said, "Oh. It's you." His
voice didn't sound friendly.</p>

<p>"It's me," I said.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're going to slap a
suit for false arrest on the Casino
now, eh, counselor?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, George," I said.
"The thought occurred to me, but I
think we can come to terms."</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to it, George. You give
us the three hundred grand and we
don't do a thing."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" He didn't get it. He had
to fork over the money anyway, according
to the court order, so what
was the deal?</p>

<p>"If you want to go a little further,
I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll
give you one of our little good luck
charms, if you'll promise to call your
boys off Howley."</p>

<p>"Nobody's on Howley," he said.
"You ought to know better than
that. In this state, if we get whipped
in court, we play it square. Did you
think we were going to get rough?"</p>

<p>"No. But you kind of figured on
lifting that gadget as soon as he gets
it back from the D.A., didn't you?
I saw your boys waiting at his hotel.
I'm just telling you that you don't
have to do that. We'll give you the
gadget. There are plenty more where
that came from."</p>

<p>"I see," Brockey said after a long
pause. "O.K., counselor. It's a deal."</p>

<p>"Fine. We'll pick up the money
later this evening, if that's O.K."</p>

<p>"Sure, counselor. Anytime. Anytime
at all." He hung up.</p>

<p>I grinned at Howley, who was sitting
across the desk from me. "Well,
that winds it up."</p>

<p>"I don't get it," Howley said.
"Why'd you call up Brockey? What
was the purpose of that 'deal'?"</p>

<p>"No deal," I told him. "I was just
warning him that killing you and
taking the gadget wouldn't do any
good, that we've covered you. He
won't bother having anything done
to you if he knows that the
secret of the gadget is out already."</p>

<p>Howley's eyes widened behind
those spectacles of his. "You mean
they'd kill me? I thought Nevada
gamblers were honest."</p>

<p>"Oh, they are, they are. But this
is a threat to their whole industry.
It's more than that, it may destroy
them. Some of them might kill to
keep that from happening. But you
don't have to worry now."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Tell me, do you think
we've succeeded?"</p>

<p>"In what you set out to do? Certainly.
When we mail out those
gadgets to people all over the state,
the place will be in an uproar. With
all the publicity this case is getting,
it'll <i>have</i> to work. You now have a
court decision on your side, a decision
which says that a psionic device
can be legally used to influence gambling
games.</p>

<p>"Why, man, they'll <i>have</i> to start
investigating! You'll have every politico
in the State of Nevada insisting
that scientists work on that thing. To
say nothing of what the syndicate
will do."</p>

<p>"All I wanted to do," said Howley,
"was force people to take notice
of psionics. I guess I've done
that."</p>

<p>"You certainly have, brother. I
wonder what it will come to?"</p>

<p>"I wonder, myself, sometimes,"
Howley said.</p>

<p>That was three and a half years
ago. Neither Howley nor I are wondering
now. According to the front
page of today's <i>Times</i>, the first
spaceship, with a crew of eighty
aboard, reached Mars this morning.
And, on page two, there's a small
article headlined: ROCKET OBSOLETE,
SAY SCIENTISTS.</p>

<p>It sure is.</p>

<p>THE END</p>
